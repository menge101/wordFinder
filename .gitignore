# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global


#ignore things that should not be checked in
.idea/
*.iml
out/
